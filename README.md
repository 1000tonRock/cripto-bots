# Cripto-bots
cryptocurrencies trading bots

the files 'bot.py' and 'parabot.py' are the principal bots
you can use the 'lucroCalc.py' to calculate the profit from the log file generated by the bots
you can use the 'backtesting.py' to test the profit using old data from binance (ex.: last week candles)
